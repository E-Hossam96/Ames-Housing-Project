# Ames-Housing-Project
In this project, I'm going to build a linear regression model to get insights about what makes a house gets sold for higher prices and predict the sold prices for different houses. I will go through some steps to clean the data and get it ready for model learning and then try different algorithms to get the best training and test Coefficients of determination (R Squared Value).
